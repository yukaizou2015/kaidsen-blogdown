```{r setup, include=F}
library(dplyr)
```

Recently, `dplyr` package added a `pull()` function which behaves similar to `select()`, but can return a vector without further processing.

Working example:

```{r}
# Loading mtcar dataset
head(mtcars)

# Get the values from column 'mpg' as a vector using select
mtcars %>% select(mpg)

# Pull the values from column 'mpg' as a vector
mtcars %>% pull(mpg)
```
