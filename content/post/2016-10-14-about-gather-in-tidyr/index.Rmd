```{r setup, include=F}
library(tidyr); library(dplyr)
```

**Update**: `gather()` is no longer maintained and it is recommended that `pivot_longer()` is used. For details, see [here](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/gather.html).

The `gather()` function is somewhat complementary to what the `spread()` function does.

- `gather(data, key, value, -variable)`

where `-` stands for "exclude", meaning that `variable` is excluded in this case.

Working example:

```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
  time = as.Date('2009-01-01') + 0:9,
  X = rnorm(10, 0, 1),
  Y = rnorm(10, 0, 2),
  Z = rnorm(10, 0, 4)
)

stocks
```

In this table, to put the variables (X, Y, and Z) into a new variable "stock", and al the values to a new variable "price", it can be achieved via below:

```{r}
gather(stocks, key = "stock", value = "price", -time)
```
