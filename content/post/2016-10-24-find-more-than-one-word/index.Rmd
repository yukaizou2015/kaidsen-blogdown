```{bash, include=F}
rm example.txt
echo Apple >> example.txt
echo Orange >> example.txt
echo Banana >> example.txt
```

`egrep` can be quite useful when sometimes one needs to extract more than one word within a piece of text.

Working example:

Here we have a txt file that has three lines of text:

```{bash}
cat example.txt
```

To find the text "Apple":

```{bash}
cat example.txt | egrep "Apple"
```

To find both "Apple" and "Banana", note that a pipe symbol is added between the two words without spacing:

```{bash}
cat example.txt | egrep "Apple|Banana"
```
