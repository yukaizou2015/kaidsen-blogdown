Just learnt today that `mapply(function(x, y), x, y)` will pass element-by-element in BOTH x AND y variable.

```{r}
mapply(function(x, y) x + y, x = c(1:3), y = c(10, 20, 30))
```

That's just amazing and got me realized the power of [vectorization in R](https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/r-novice-gapminder/09-vectorization/).
