# Kubernetes

This Coronation Bank Holiday weekend, I learnt something about Kubernetes and it's such a great management tool for deploying containerised solutions. This is a home project that I'm slowly working on. Can start with the Gaming PC and Optiplex.

# Bland-Altman plots

I grasped the concept as similar to Tukey mean difference plot, but was called differently in the field of medicine statistics. 

There is an R package `{BlandAltmanLeh}` which does this job. 

Read this [step-by-step tutorial](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/08/plot-differences-in-two-measurements-bland-altman-plot-in-r/) that dives in with loads of details.
