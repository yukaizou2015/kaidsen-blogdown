```{r setup, include=F}
library(dplyr)
```

Different from `grep()` which outputs the _indices_ of the matched pattern, `grepl()` returns logical `TRUE/FALSE` values.

We look at the `cyl` variable in mtcars sets as example:

```{r}
mtcars$cyl
```

To find out what entries are 6-cylinder engines, `grep()` will return the indices of the vector (and omit the rest):

```{r}
grep(6, mtcars$cyl)
```

whereas `grepl()` will return logical values for the entire vector.

```{r}
grepl(6, mtcars$cyl)
```

The outputs vary in terms of the datatypes and lengths, which can be useful to serve difference processing scenarios.
