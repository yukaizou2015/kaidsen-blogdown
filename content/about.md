# Hello!

My name is Yukai Zou and I am an MRI Physicist at the University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust in the UK. I earned my PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Purdue University in the US.

I am currently pursuing the [ACS Route 2](https://assclinsci.org/applicants/my-route-to-registration/) towards HCPC registration as a Clinical Scientist. Before taking on this role, I have worked at the University of Southampton as a postdoctoral research fellow for two years. I am very excited about the transition from academia to the NHS, and I’d like to see how I can help translate some of the research skills into clinical practice, as well as supporting the clinical research work at the UHS.

In my spare time, I enjoy cooking Asian cuisines, playing ukulele, running, swimming, and exploring different places by hiking and camping.

# What's this blog about?

_"kaidsen"_ stands for "Kai's Data Science Efficiency Notebook." A few reasons behind this name:
 - Kai is my common name.
 - "dsen" stands for Data Sciences Efficiency Notebook which I started back in 2015.
 - Kaidsen sounds similar to [kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen), meaning _continuous improvement_ (改善).

I started this notebook back in 2015 when I was studying medical imaging at the University of California San Francisco. I took the online course "Data Sciences Specialization" at Coursera, which a good friend recommended to me. At that time, I gave this notebook a name:"Data Sciences Efficiency" - by all means, I believed those skills could at least help me analyze data more efficiently. I used R for the statistical analyses in my [masters thesis](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/59r8j62k), I built a [Shiny app](https://boilerkai.shinyapps.io/PNG_dMRI_xPatch/) in my [PhD thesis](https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/Developing_Population-Specific_Brain_Atlases_and_Monitoring_Repetitive_Head_Impacts_for_Early-to-Middle_Adolescent_Collision-Sport_Athletes/12749267/1), and I [programmed in R and Python to process large datasets](https://github.com/yukaizou2015/miccai_abcd_np_purdue150) at the [ABCD Neurocognitive Challenge](https://sibis.sri.com/abcd-np-challenge/). Over the years, this notebook accumulated small bits of R functions, as well as some Python and bash scripts. I now decide to make these notes public in the hope that they serve useful resources for the community.

# Inspirations

I love reading. I read a lot every day, and I often get inspired by thoughts from other data sciences enthusiasts. Some of my favorite blogs and podcast are [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/), [Simply Statistics](https://simplystatistics.org/), [Not So Standard Deviations](https://nssdeviations.com/), and more recently [Econometrics and Free Software](https://www.brodrigues.co/). I have gained many useful tips about using R and best practices in data sciences techniques, and through these channels I keep myself updated about what is going on.

# The Inconvenient Truth, from [Kamil Bartocha](https://www.kbartocha.com)

1. Data is never clean.
2. You will spend most of your time cleaning and preparing data.
3. 95% of tasks do not require deep learning.
4. In 90% of cases generalized linear regression will do the trick.
5. Big Data is just a tool.
6. You should embrace the Bayesian approach.
7. No one cares how you did it.
8. Academia and business are two different worlds.
9. Presentation is key - be a master of Power Point.
10. All models are false, but some are useful.
11. There is no fully automated Data Science. You need to get your hands dirty.
